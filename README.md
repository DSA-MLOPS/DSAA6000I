# DSA 6000I: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM Ops
### Fall 2023: Friday 9:30AM-12:00PM HKT

## Co-instructors
* Sung Kim
* Jungwoo Ha

## Course Overview:
This course will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their practical applications in a production environment, using LLM Ops methodology. We will explore the latest developments in LLMs and LLM Ops, as well as hands-on training in developing, deploying, and evaluating LLMs.

## Potential Project Topics:
Students will work on individual or group projects that involve the development or evaluation of LLMs in a production environment. Here are 4 potential project topics:

* Fine-tuning an existing LLM, such as GPT, for a specific task or domain. For example, you could train the LLM to generate product descriptions, analyze customer feedback, or summarize news articles.

* Developing a small-scale LLM from scratch, perhaps using a pre-existing architecture such as OpenAI's GPT architecture. This could be a great opportunity to experiment with different training techniques and see how they affect the quality and performance of the LLM.

* Implementing LLMs in practical contexts, such as developing an LLM-powered chatbot for customer service, or training an LLM to classify and analyze medical data for clinical decision-making.

* Evaluating the performance of LLMs, perhaps by comparing the results of different models on a specific task or dataset. This could involve testing the LLMs on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and analyzing the factors that contribute to their performance.

### Week 6-7 Oct 27/Nov3: Project Development
- Students will work on their individual or group projects, with guidance and support from instructors as needed.

### Week 8 Nov 10: LLM Evaluation and Testing
- Students will learn about evaluation metrics for LLM models, and will test their models on a test dataset to measure accuracy, recall, and other performance indicators.

### Week 9 Nov 17: LLM Deployment
- Students will learn about best practices for deploying LLM models to production environments, and will deploy their models to a cloud-based production environment using a CI/CD pipeline.

### Week 10 Nov 24: LLM Monitoring and Maintenance

### Week 11-12 Dec 1: Project Presentations
- Students will learn about monitoring and maintenance techniques for LLM models in a production environment, and will set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms for their deployed models.
- Final project presentations to the class, and feedback from instructors and peers.
- Course review and wrap-up.

Overall, the course will provide students with a solid understanding of LLM Ops methodology, as well as hands-on experience in developing, deploying, and evaluating LLMs in a production environment. This skill set is essential for any career in the field of natural language processing. The course will be co-taught by Sung Kim and Jungwoo Ha, who have extensive experience in the field and have worked on a variety of LLM-based projects.

We encourage students with a background in natural language processing, machine learning, or data science to enroll in this course. Students should have experience with programming languages such as Python, and familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
