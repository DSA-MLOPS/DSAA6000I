# DSA 6000E: Model to Production: ML Ops for Real Industry
### Spring 2024: Friday 9:00AM-11:50PM HKT @Rm202, W4 or Zoom

## Co-instructors
* Sung Kim
* Jungwoo Ha (Adjunct Prof)

## Course Overview:
This course will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their practical applications in a production environment, using LLM Ops methodology. We will explore the latest developments in LLMs and LLM Ops, as well as hands-on training in developing, deploying, and evaluating LLMs.

## Potential Project Topics:
Students will work on individual or group projects that involve the development or evaluation of LLMs in a production environment. Here are 3 potential project topics:

* Fine-tuning an existing LLM, such as GPT, for a specific task or domain. For example, you could train the LLM to generate product descriptions, analyze customer feedback, or summarize news articles.
* Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LIYx35-fPFMBS39UzEqf9a4_g7cWEXIg

* Implementing LLMs in practical contexts, such as developing an LLM-powered chatbot for customer service, or training an LLM to classify and analyze medical data for clinical decision-making.

* Evaluating the performance of LLMs, perhaps by comparing the results of different models on a specific task or dataset. This could involve testing the LLMs on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and analyzing the factors that contribute to their performance.

## Grading breakdown:

* Participations: 10%
* Inclass test: 10%
* Homework: 20%
* Mid-project proposal: 20%
* Final project: 40%

### Qingming Festival Break Apr 5

### Week 10 Apr 12: AI Regulations (Hwaran Lee from Naver) Zoom
* Talk1: Hwran Lee from Naver


### Week 11 Apr 19: Project Presentations Poster session GZ
- Students will learn about monitoring and maintenance techniques for LLM models in a production environment, and will set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms for their deployed models.
- Final project presentations to the class, and feedback from instructors and peers.
- Course review and wrap-up.

Overall, the course will provide students with a solid understanding of LLM Ops methodology, as well as hands-on experience in developing, deploying, and evaluating LLMs in a production environment. This skill set is essential for any career in the field of natural language processing. The course will be co-taught by Sung Kim and Jungwoo Ha, who have extensive experience in the field and have worked on a variety of LLM-based projects.

We encourage students with a background in natural language processing, machine learning, or data science to enroll in this course. Students should have experience with programming languages such as Python, and familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
